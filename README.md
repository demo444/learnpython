# learnpython
Introduction to using Python for Data Science Course

This module includes code examples and data files for learning python.  No prior knowledge of Python is assumed.

If you are new to Python, complete the lessons in order, starting with Lesson 1.

If you are an intermediate user or already familiar with Python, you may wish to complete the questions in Challenge.txt BEFORE looking at the lessons.  If you get stuck or wish to validate your answers, you can refer to the Lessons for the solution.

You can get your own personal pre-loaded, functional Jupyter Notebook with these examples at:
https://gesis.mybinder.org/binder/v2/gh/demo444/learnpython/master

The regular Python example code is in the .py files.  However, if you are using Jupyter Notebook, you want to open the .ipynb versions instead.  For example, to start Lesson 1, open Lesson1-HelloWorld.ipynb.  If you are using the mybinder.org link above to view these in Jupyter Notebook and want to run and/or modify the examples yourself (rather than just looking at the outputs), then to clear out the prior runs, make sure that after you open an .ipynb file you go to the "Kernel" menu and choose "Restart & Clear Output".  You can then edit and/or run each cell of code at your leisure.  You can also create new Python 3 Notebooks using mybinder.org, and recreate the Jupyter Notebook examples yourself from scratch, while referring back to the example files.

If you use mybinder.org, you do not need to manually download and upload the data files.

Note that for Lesson 4, the original source file (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties.csv) is fairly large (>100MB).  For easy of access/performance, you can instead utilize the us-counties.csv file in this repository, which is a date-limited subset of the original sample data.
