Lesson 4:

Print the first 3 rows of the CSV file at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties.csv

How many unique values are there for the 'state' column?

Which state appears the most frequently?

List each state in alphabetical order.

Plot the number of cases and number of deaths in Dallas, Texas over time, all on one graph, using matplotlib.


Lesson 5:

Open the file at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demo444/learnpython/master/sample.txt

This file contains a description of financial transactions by several individuals.  Using Python only (without manually editing the file), create a two-dimensional array that has a row for each transaction, and columns that include:

date (in the form YYYY-MM-DD)
time (in 24 hour format HH:MM:SS)
amount (number of dollars)
paid (which will have the value 'paid' if money was paid and 'received' if it was received)
person (the person's name)

Convert the array to a data frame and sort the rows chronologically, in order of occurrence.

Export the result to a CSV file.
